Features:
====================

Turbo Boost Switcher is a little application for Mac computers that allows to enable and/or disable the Turbo Boost feature.

It installs a precompiled kernel extension (32 or 64 bits depending on your system) that updates the Turbo Boost MSR register, so It will ask for your admin password when using it.

It’s installed on your Mac status bar and allows you to:

- Visually know if Turbo Boost is enabled or disabled at any time.
- Enable / Disable Turbo Boost.
- Check your CPU temp and fan speed.
- Set it to open at login.

How to install:
====================

You can download the binary application or the source code to compile it with XCode.

Once downloaded/compiled, just unzip and double click on your “Turbo Boost Switcher.app”.

If you see a message saying the app “can’t be opened because it is from an identified developer”, then you need to change your settings to allow not-signed apps to be installed. Go to your System Preferences->Security and Privacy and mark the option “Anyhwere”. Try again, it should work.
